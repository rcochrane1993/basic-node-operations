1. Sort lists the file alphabetically based on line. when i ran it the lines showed up in alphabetical order.
Wc- prints the number of lines, words and characters in a file. hwne ran on commands.js the result is `39 98 1058`
uniq- removes adjacent repeated lines. Since no lines are repeated adjacently, the console simply printed the whole file.

2. i used the command `$ sort commands.js | uniq` which first sorted the lines of the file alphabetically then removed any files
that were repeated, since they were listed alphbetically any repeated lines were already adjacent and therefore one of the lines was removed
i believe the only line that was removed was once of the instances of `break`

reverse string

function reverseString(inputString) {
  var arr = inputString.split('');
  return arr.reverse().join('')
}
